  ##Flyplan - Finding cheap flights made easy 

We are developing a visually appealing flight tickets tracker that enables users to compare prices across different flights easily. Currently, users face the issue of having multiple tabs open while searching for the best option for a flight. Our solution aims to tackle this problem by providing a unique dashboard that allows users to customize their preferred options, thereby reducing the mental effort and complexity associated with tracking multiple flight options.

Moreover, we plan to incorporate additional features, such as weather information for the searched location, and price change notifications for saved flights. Our flight tracker will offer a comprehensive set of features, including flight ticket search, auto-suggest, saving/deleting favorites, filters, authentication, weather information, and price notifications.
